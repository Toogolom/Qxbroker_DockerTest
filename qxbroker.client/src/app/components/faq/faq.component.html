                    <div>Option is a derivative financial instrument based on any underlying asset, such as a stock, a currency pair, oil, etc.</div><br>
                    <div>Digital option - a non-standard option that is used to make a profit on price movements of such assets for a certain period of time.</div><br>
                    <div>A digital option, depending on the terms agreed upon by the parties to the transaction, at a time determined by the parties, brings a fixed income (the difference between the trade income and the price of the asset) or loss (in the amount of the value of the asset).</div>
                    <div>Since the digital option is purchased in advance at a fixed price, the size of the profit, as well as the size of the potential loss, are known even before the trade.</div><br>
                    <div>Another feature of these deals is the time limit. Any option has its own term (expiration time or conclusion time).</div>
                    <div>Regardless of the degree of change in the price of the underlying asset (how much it has become higher or lower), in case of winning an option, a fixed payment is always made. Therefore, your risks are limited only by the amount for which the option is acquired.</div>

                    <div>An underlying asset is an “item” whose price is taken into account when concluding a trade.As the underlying asset of digital options, the most sought-after products on the markets usually act. There are four types of them:</div>

It is important for you to determine only the direction of movement of this price.</div>
                    <div>If your prognosis is correct, in any case you get a fixed income.</div>
